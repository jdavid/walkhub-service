WalkHub is looking for a maintainer and no longer supported. Pronovix (pronovix.com), the company that originally sponsored WalkHubâ€™s development has focussed its activities around developer portals (API documentation) and is as a result unfortunately unable to provide any support for the project. The code is available as is, and we hope a developer with an interest in the project might be able to still use the code.

# WalkHub

Walkthrough tutorials designed for web applications and websites.
Add a record button and help center to your web application.

Check the [landing page](http://pronovix.com/walkhub) for more information.

# Getting started

## Dependencies

* Go 1.7+
* PostgreSQL 9.5
* NPM 3.x
* Node.js 4.x ([5.x does not work](https://github.com/Pronovix/walkhub-service/issues/12))

## Configuration

	cp config.json.minimal config.json
	$EDITOR config.json

Any configuration value can be overridden with an environment variable.

### Docker

[The official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pronovix/walkhub-service/) uses an empty configuration file. You either have to provide all configuration through environment variables, or you have to create an image and replace the empty configuration file.

### Mandatory values

* `db`: connection string to the PostgreSQL database
* `secret`: 32 bytes long random byte sequence, encoded with hex encoding
* `cookiesecret`: 32 bytes long random byte sequence, encoded with hex encoding
* `baseurl`: the url where WalkHub will be. A default is set in the example config files.

At least one of the following authentication providers are mandatory:

* `google`: OAuth2 tokens for Google (see config.json.sample.full)
* `pwauth`: password authentication

If password authentication is enabled, then SMTP credentials are mandatory:

* `smtp`: SMTP credentials (see config.json.sample.full). Only PLAIN authentication ([RFC4616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4616)) is supported.

### Optional values

If unsure, leave them empty.

* `host`: host to listen on. Defaults to `localhost`.
* `port`: port to listen on. Defaults to `8080`.
* `letsencrypthost`: enables letsencrypt on the specified host. Default is empty.
* `httpaddr`: enables HTTP to HTTPS automatic redirection. The format of the address is `host:port`.
* `httporigin`: if this is set, the HTTP requests will be forced to a separate domain.
* `redirectall`: redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS if the server is running in HTTPS mode. If this is set to false, only a few pages will be enabled in HTTP mode
* `contentpages`: path to a JSON file that describes custom pages. The JSON file is a simple dictionary, where the key is the path (see react-router for the syntax) and the value is the `require()` path for the component
* `frontpagecomponent`: overrides the component for the front page
* `footercomponent`: overrides the component for the footer
* `extrabuild`: a javascript file that exports a single function. This function can alter the webpack config.
* `menuitems`: path to a JSON file that describes menu paths. Only change this if you want to change the menu of the site. See `js/components/wrappers/app.js` for more info on the structure.
* `googleanalyticsaccount`: enables Google Analytics.
* `mailchimp`: mailchimp-related configuration. If set, new users will be added to a mailing list.
* `metricsaddresses`: comma separated whitelist of addresses from where the `/metrics` endpoint is accessible
* `languages`: list of languages for the user interface
* `domain`: the document domain (see Same-origin policy)

## Build & Run

First you have to build the assets:

	npm install
	npm run build

Run the server:

	go run cmd/walkhub/main.go

## Quick start with Docker compose

This is a basic configuration to launch WalkHub locally. DO NOT use this in production. To maximize security for your GMail account, it is highly recommended to enable 2-factor authentication and create an app password for WalkHub.

	web:
		image: pronovix/walkhub-service
		restart: always
		ports:
			- "8080:8080"
		links:
			- db
		environment:
			HOST: "0.0.0.0"
			DB: "host=db dbname=postgres user=docker password=docker sslmode=disable"
			BASEURL: "http://localhost:8080/"
			SECRET: "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
			COOKIESECRET: "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
			PWAUTH: "true"
			SMTP_ADDR: "smtp.gmail.com:587"
			SMTP_IDENTITY: ""
			SMTP_USERNAME: "<your gmail address>"
			SMTP_PASSWORD: "<your gmail password>"
			SMTP_FROM: "<your gmail address>"
			SMTP_HOST: "smtp.gmail.com"
	db:
		image: postgres:latest
		restart: always
		environment:
			POSTGRES_PASSWORD: docker
			POSTGRES_USER: docker

On startup the frontend assets will be built, and the server starts. You can visit the site at http://localhost:8080 after 20-40 seconds, depending on your hardware.
